# Lab
## Pre-requisites : 
create a Firebase project and app, get your API key and put them in a "environment.ts" file under src/app with the following pattern : 
```
    export const environment = {
     firebase : {
        apiKey: "your-api-key",
        authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
        projectId: "your-project-id",
        storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
        messagingSenderId: "your-messaing-sender-id",
        appId: "your-app-id",
        measurementId: "your-measurement-id"
      },
};
```
all of which you can easily copy from the firebase application site

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
